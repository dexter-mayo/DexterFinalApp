# EnvironMe
With climate change happening right before our eyes, it's important that everyone does their part to help the environment. No matter how small, your everyday actions affect the earth. EnvironMe aims to provide useful information on how to cut down on your environmental impact.  

# Process 
I started out by planning how EnvironMe would look and each segue within the app. It's super helpful to have an outline and an aesthetic or color theme before you start so you're not having to go back and change what you already finished. This app is information-based, which required a lot of research prior to actual coding. All the information on the app is researched and written by me. After, I started the process of actually coding the view controllers and how the information would appear.
